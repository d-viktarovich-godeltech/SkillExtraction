I need to create an Skill Extraction Tool which would allow to upload a CV and, extracts skills from it. Each session should be saved to user profile upload history for review or removal in future. Application should consist of Front End and Back End application, have simple authentication to allow storage of data for list of users.

Application should contain several pages:
1) Landing page
2) Login and Registration page
3) CV upload page 
4) Profile page to review or remove uploaded CVs with extracted skills

I'd propose to store FE and BE in single repository but in separate subfolders FrontEnd/BackEnd. 

Technologies:
AspNetCore for BE 
React for FE. 
DuckDb as DB
ChatGPT to extract skills from 
I'd like to store CV (pdfs) in filesystem in specified folder
I'd like to store all users and their data in DuckDB

Your task is to plan how can I implement this service and propose list of tasks with short description of what should be done. Tasks should be separated to backend/frontend.
If you have any questions, ask them before generating the plan. Propose top 3 improvements that you could suggest

------------------------------------

Start implementation

------------------------------------

Create .github folder with basic instructions that could be extended

------------------------------------

Please remove content of .github folder

------------------------------------

please try to run backend application and fix errors

------------------------------------

Save prompt from this conversation to file Prompts/plan-and-implementation-prompts.txt. Split all commands by horisontal line delimiter. e.g.
command1

------------------------------------

command2

------------------------------------

command3

------------------------------------

i tried to install npms with npm install command but got error. How to fix that?

npm : Невозможно загрузить файл C:\Program Files\nodejs\npm.ps1, так как выполнение сценариев отключено в этой системе.

------------------------------------

How to run FrontEnd project?

------------------------------------

My backend runs at port https://localhost:5000 but FE tries to reach https://localhost:7199. Could you fix that?

------------------------------------

Please add correct processing of CORS requests for backend

------------------------------------

I've updated several files to correctly bind FE and BE. Be aware of that

------------------------------------

When i try to upload CV I get error. Why is that happens?
"error": "Could not find a part of the path 'D:\\GodelLearning\\SkillExtraction\\BackEnd\\SkillExtraction.Api\\uploads\\cvs\\uploads\\cvs\\4_20260215125858_ac8ce4c5-a6ff-4670-92e3-bb6a1cf253b4.jpg'."

------------------------------------

Backend does not try to load appsettings.Local.json. Can you fix that?

------------------------------------

Wen I upload CV i get BE exception. Could you fix that?
"error": "Binder Error: Table \"CvUploads\" does not have a column with name \"StoragePath\"\n\nDid you mean: \"FilePath\""

------------------------------------

How can I install new custom agents in vscode?

------------------------------------

Now I'm getting error 
"error": "Constraint Error: NOT NULL constraint failed: CvUploads.ProcessingStatus"

------------------------------------

On backend after analysis and cleaning of response JsonSerializer cannot deserialize response for some reason.
example of cleaned response that it tries to deserialize:

"{\n  \"summary\": \"Store Manager with extensive experience in automotive sales management, demonstrating excellent leadership skills and the ability to improve store operations and drive sales. Proven track record in coaching employees and managing service and repair goals.\",\n  \"skills\": [\n    \"Leadership skills\",\n    \"Sales management\",\n    \"Employee coaching\",\n    \"Service management\",\n    \"Budget management\",\n    \"Organizational capacity\",\n    \"Business development\",\n    \"Effective marketing\",\n    \"Ability to motivate staff\",\n    \"Good relations management\",\n    \"Resistance to stress\"\n  ]\n}"

------------------------------------

It successfully extracts response and summary from response of OpenAI but for some reason there are no Summary in response of backend service

------------------------------------

I have 1 CV uploaded. When I go to History page I see blank page. Why? I assume problem in FE

------------------------------------

please add all prompts that were used in this chat to Prompts/plan-and-implementation-prompts.txt

------------------------------------

You can see all previous prompts in Prompts/plan-and-implementation-prompts.txt just for context. I asked to split BE project to 3 projects (Api/Core/Data) before. As I see there are duplicated services like DbContext and FileStorage. Your task to remove duplicates and leave only one copy of service. Make sure that service is still functional after changes by build.

------------------------------------

Split all models from DTOs/ApiDtos to separate files and put them in Models folder.

------------------------------------

Add all prompts from this conversation to Prompts/plan-and-implementation-prompts.txt

------------------------------------

What is UserDto? In case it is ResponseModel could you please rename it to UserResponse
